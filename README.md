# Foogle

### Getting started

Clone repo then
```
npm install
npm run start
```

This will open a browser window and let you use the app!

### TODOs
- Submit and save forms do not give visual feedback, but still function.

### Helpers
Inside App.js there are two helper methods:
- `app.clearAllData()` Will clear out the data store.
- `app.loadFixtureData()` Will clear out the data store and load in a template set of data.
